# Round-Robin-Arbiter

This is a parametrized round robin arbiter written in SystemVerilog with a testbench. It was built in EDA Playground and simulated with Icarus Verilog 12.0.

Here are its features:
1. Fair arbitration with a round-robin scehem
2. Parametrizable requests (default in the design is 4)
3. One-hot output grant
